# Stack Problems (C Implementation)

This folder contains my practice and implementations of classic **stack-based problems** in C.  
Each problem is solved using stack logic (array-based or manual implementation) to strengthen my **DSA foundations** and prepare for placements.

## ðŸ“‚ Problems Implemented

- **bracket_checker.c** â€“ Validates balanced parentheses/brackets using a stack.  
- **find_length_validString.c** â€“ Finds the length of the longest valid parentheses substring.  
- **max_diff_btwNext_smaller.c** â€“ Finds maximum difference between left and right "next smaller elements".  
- **next_greater.c** â€“ Finds the next greater element for each array element.  
- **pairwise_destruct.c** â€“ Demonstrates pairwise element removal using stack.  
- **postfix_eval.c** â€“ Evaluates postfix expressions using stack.  
- **rev_each_word.c** â€“ Reverses each word in a string using stack operations.  
- **reverse_string.c** â€“ Reverses an entire string using a stack.  
- **subarray_first_min.c** â€“ Finds the first minimum element in every subarray using stack logic.  
- **tower_of_hanoi.c** â€“ Solves Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion (and conceptual stack).

## ðŸš€ Key Learnings
- How to implement stacks using arrays.  
- Solving real problems like expression evaluation and stock-like challenges.  
- Difference between naive and optimized stack approaches.  
- Recursive solutions as implicit stack usage.  


ðŸ’¡ *This folder is part of my DSA preparation journey. Each problem shows how stack concepts can be applied to solve real-world coding challenges.*
