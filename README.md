# ðŸ“˜ Data Structures in C â€“ My Coding Journey  

This repository is an account of my coding journey in **Data Structures using C language**.  
By the time I sit for placements in **2028**, I hope to:  
- Solidify my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms.  
- Solve a large number of problems in **increasing order of difficulty**.  
- Build the problem-solving mindset needed for real-world applications.

## ðŸš€ Goals  
- Daily practice and consistency.  
- Clear, well-structured solutions with comments.  
- Tracking progress over the years until placements.
